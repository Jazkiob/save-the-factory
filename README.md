# save-the-factory
A simple Boardgame that requires you to save the factory of the future. "It's like werewolf but with factories..."

## Five resorts in which you can invest

In total there are 5 different resorts that have to be considered while playing.

### Machinery

On machine uses one raw material to produce one product which is then sold for profit. In the factory of the future the production step does not necessarily require humans due to the advancements of technology.
They require however to be maintained regulary. Otherwise they become unavailable.

| Worker       | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4      |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Availability | 60% | 80% | 90% | 95% | 97.25% |

Cost per new machine: 5 $

### Research and Developement

Investment in R&D can result in benefits in all ressorts including sales. It requires investment of both workers and money. A succesfull discovery can lead to a random improvement in any of the ressorts. (The impact of the improvement is described in the ressort itself)

| Worker        | 0   | 1   | 2     | 3     | 4     |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Money         | 0   | 1   | 2     | 3     | 4     |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Discovery    | 0% | 25% | 40% | 50% | 55% |

Cost per new research facility: 5 $

### Raw material

Raw material is the base for poducing goods. In order to procure ressource a worker has to be assigned to purchasing.
The "raw material" tiles represent the storage capacity of the factory. You can't purchase more than your maximum storage.

1 tile = 3 Storage = 3 Pieces of raw materials

| Worker       | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1      |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Money   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Ressource    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

Cost per new storage: 5 $
Improvement: A storage tile holds +1 of raw material.

### Sustainability

In the scenario of the future, sustainability is curcial to the attractiveness of a factory due to the change in society.
If the factory is sustainable, hapiness of the employees rises and the chance of the gain of workers rises due to positive publicity.

To emulate that sustainability is a long run investment it is considered as a ressource that can be incremented.

1 Tile = 3 Possible sustainability ressources

| Worker       | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3  | 4      |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Effekt on sustainability ressource  | -1 | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 |

For each sustainability ressource +10 % that a worker joins the factory.
